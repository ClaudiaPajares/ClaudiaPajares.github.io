        <p>
            Dear Eileen, <br></p>
        <p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>

            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to
                have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
                </li>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2>Exotic dance move</h2>
            <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole, village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>

                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelander developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements.
                    One of my fellows students used to say tha he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
                </dd>

                <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorer in the 1960s belved to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later
                    on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
                </dd>
            </dl>
